# Water Erosion for Minecraft

**Water Erosion makes the world evolve with streams and waterfalls.**

Find Forest brooks and Mountain creeks during your explorations. Dirt and sand
wash away to deepen the stream bed and cut banks into the environment. The
landscapes become more diverse and unique. Pass through a dry Desert valley one
day and find it flooded the next. A stream may even change direction to dry up
the original flow.

## Goal

Implement Erosion as though it were a regular Minecraft feature making the world
more dynamic. It should not break existing gameplay or enable cheating.
